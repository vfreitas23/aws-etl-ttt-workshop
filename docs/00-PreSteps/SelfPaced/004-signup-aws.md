If you've already signed up for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and have a user with administrator access, you can move on to Deploy CloudFormation Template.

If you haven't signed up for AWS account yet, or if you need assistance, follow the following instructions to set up your AWS account for the workshop.

Sign Up for AWS

When you sign up for Amazon Web Services (AWS), your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS, including Lake Formation. You are charged only for the services that you use. If you have an AWS account already, skip to the next task. If you don't have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one.

To create an AWS account

    Open https://aws.amazon.com/

    and then choose Create an AWS Account.

If you previously signed in to the AWS Management Console using AWS account root user credentials, choose Sign in to a different account. If you previously signed in to the console using IAM credentials, choose Sign-in using root account credentials. Then choose Create a new AWS account.

    Follow the online instructions. Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code using the phone keypad. Note your AWS account number, because you'll need it for the next task.
