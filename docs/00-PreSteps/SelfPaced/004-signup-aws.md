SIGN UP FOR AWS
</h1>

When you sign up for **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, your **AWS account** is automatically signed up for **all services in AWS, including Lake Formation**. You are charged only for the services that you use.

If you've already signed up for **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and have a user with **administrator access**, you can move on to [Deploy CloudFormation Template](https://vfreitas23.github.io/aws-etl-ttt-workshop/00-PreSteps/SelfPaced/006-deploy-cfn/).

If you haven't **signed up for AWS account** yet, or if you need assistance, follow the following instructions to set up your **AWS account** for the workshop.

### Sign Up for AWS

To create an AWS account:

**1\.** Open [https://aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and then choose C**reate an AWS Account**.  

> *If you previously signed in to the AWS Management Console using AWS account root user credentials, choose Sign in to a different account. If you previously signed in to the console using IAM credentials, choose Sign-in using root account credentials. Then choose Create a new AWS account.*


**2\.** Follow the online instructions. Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code using the phone keypad. **Note your AWS account number**, because you'll need it for the next task.
